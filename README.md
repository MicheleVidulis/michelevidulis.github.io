# Personal Webpage

This repository hosts my personal webpage via GitHub Pages.

## Usage

Make sure Hugo **extended version** (v0.90+) is [installed](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/). Clone with `--recursive` flag.

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:MicheleVidulis/michelevidulis.github.io.git
```

To preview the website locally, run:

```bash
hugo serve
```

To build the static files, run:

```bash
hugo
```

This will generate the static files in the `public/` directory, which can then be deployed to GitHub Pages.
Note that the files generated by `hugo serve` are not meant to be deployed, so always use `hugo` to build the site for deployment.
GitHub Pages will automatically serve the content of the `docs/` directory from the `main` branch, so move the contents of `public/` to `docs/` before pushing to GitHub:


```bash
mv public/* docs/
```


## Credits

The website is based on [Desmond](https://desmondlzy.me/)'s design, [Bloggraph](https://github.com/desmondlzy/bloggraph), a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme for showcasing research projects and profiles.
